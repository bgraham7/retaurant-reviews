# Arcade Game
===============================
## Synopsis
Check out restaurants and their reviews using mapbox!

## Requirements
In order to run the site, I recommend using Chrome Web Server extension. If you want to use a python server, make sure to edit the dbhelper.js file at line 12 for the correct port. Otherwise everything, including the service worker, should work by default.
